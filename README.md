# Missing_data_Coca-Cola Dashboard

From January to March 2023, I received advice and support from professionals working in technology companies to develop this Coca-Cola Stock Analytics dashboard. This is a personal project I built to put in practice the tools I am currently learning. 

I built this dashboard by pulling the information from Kaggle Coca-Cola (link) public dataset. I used Google Sheets and Dataiku DSS for experiments and parse the dates column. I used Looker Studio to create this dashboard to facilitate the decision-making analysis of shareholders (CEO, current employees) and prospectus who are considering investing in Coca-Cola's Stocks. 

## Coca-Cola Stocks Analytics 

The Kaggle Coca-Cola Stock History dataset ranges from January 2, 1962 to October 26, 2022. The weekends and holidays were missing in the original data. Following domain of expertise principles, I added the missing rows and filled them with the value of the previous row. Some of the information found in this dataset is: 

* High price 
* Close price 
* Stock splits 
* Dividends
* Volume 

I believe other interesting analysis can be done with this dataset. 

## Questions answered on this dashboard

1. What are the stock splits per trimester per year? 
2. What are the dividends? 
3. Does the high price increases or decreases year-of-year (YoY)? 
4. Does the close price increases or decreases year-of-year (YoY)? 
5. Is Coca-Cola stock history showing reliable long-term investment based on their history data?
